## Pipette Repair
Purpose: The undergraduate bench pippette was dropped and the depressor broke off leaving sharp plastic at the top. The pipette was still functioning properly, but the sharp edges posed a danger to gloves and fingers. 

Material: Sugru is a moldable putty glue that hardens into a silicon rubber. Given the probability of this pipette to be dropped again, I didn't want to use anything that shatters (3D printed ABS). I also wanted something that was not perfectly smooth (lab tape) to allow for easier adjustment of the attached dial. 

Outcome: Undergraduates approved. $200 saved. PI happy.
